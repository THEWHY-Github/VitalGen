# VitalGen
Generates presets for the free software synth Vital


To use, move the files named 'gen.py' and 'config.json' into Vital's presets folder (C:\Users\User\Documents\Vital\User\Presets on Windows).
Create a preset with 3 oscillators that have any wavetable you want (I recommend 'Basic Shapes' with Waveform blend enabled) and any 2 filters then save it.
Run gen.py and type in the name of the preset you just created.
On vital, open any other preset, the reopen the one you just created to reload it.

If you want to edit what the generator can and can't generate, you can edit the config.json file
